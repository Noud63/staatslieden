      "The Staatsliedenbuurt is a neighborhood in Amsterdam located in the district of West.",
      "The neighborhood lies south of the Haarlemmertrekvaart and west of the waterway route Singelgracht - Kattensloot - Kostverlorenvaart.",
      "The area emerged in the 19th century and has since undergone various transformations. Originally a working-class neighborhood, it has developed into a vibrant and multicultural community.",
      "The neighborhood is named after the statesmen of the Netherlands, who played an important role in the country's history."

    "content_a2": [
      "When it comes to the history of the Staatsliedenbuurt, the question is: where does that history begin? Where should you start telling that story?",
      "Given the geographical location of the Staatsliedenbuurt in the area that once belonged to the former municipality of Sloten, the period before the annexation (1877–1896–1921) by Amsterdam, when Sloten lost its independence and land to the city, certainly deserves attention here."

    "content_a3": [
      "Everything located between the IJ (and later the North Sea Canal) to the north and the Nieuwe Meer to the south belonged before 1877 to Sloten.\n",
      "On the sides, the Schinkel and the Kostverlorenkade on one side and the Ringvaart of the Haarlemmermeer on the other side were considered the municipal boundaries.\n",
      "Around the year 1000, the area gradually began to be developed and the first villages emerged.\n",
      "According to the history of this area, the first mention of a chapel in Sloton was recorded by monks between the years 993 and 1049 in a medieval prayer book.\n",
      "Sloten is therefore about two centuries older than Amsterdam!\n",
      "Sloten, which had been a municipality since 1816, was annexed by Amsterdam in 1921. The city had already been expanding since the last quarter of the 19th century, at the expense of the surrounding municipalities.\n",
      "In 1877, a part of Sloten west of the Haarlemmerpoort was already taken over: the Spaarndammerbuurt and part of the Staatsliedenbuurt were built here.\n",
      "The tow canal from Amsterdam to Haarlem (Haarlemmervaart) was and still is the northern boundary of the neighborhood.\n",
      "The main attraction was Inn d'Eenhonderd Roe, a tavern just outside the city limits that did not have to pay municipal taxes.\n",
      "The inn was located at a distance of one hundred rods (almost four hundred meters) west of the Haarlemmerpoort, the former municipal boundary with Amsterdam and, from 1632 to 1883, the departure point of the tow barge to Haarlem.\n",
      "In 1896, another small part of Sloten was cut off. On January 1, 1921, the entire municipality of Sloten was dissolved and incorporated into Amsterdam.\n",
      "Here, the neighborhoods of Plan West, Bos en Lommer, and the Western Garden Cities were built.\n",
      "The residents of Sloten and the last mayor did resist the annexation, but reportedly alderman Willem Hendrik de Buisonjé played a dubious role by claiming, as a member of parliament for the liberal Economic Union, that the residents were in favor of annexation."
    ],
    "content_a4": [
      "The construction of the Staatsliedenbuurt addressed the growing need for housing due to the rapidly increasing population. There was especially a need for affordable workers' housing.\n",
      "Private investors created new housing supply through 'revolutionary construction.' After the Housing Act was introduced in 1901, housing associations such as Rochdale and De Arbeiderswoning also began building initiatives.\n",
      "The first Housing Act homes in the Netherlands are located on Van Beuningenstraat."

      "Here you will find the demographic data of the neighborhood.\n",
      "But what is demography actually?\n",
      "Demography is the study or science of populations. It examines how a population group (community) is composed.\n",
      "It looks at things like age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, education level, marital status, and occupation.\n",
      "This also involves social sciences such as geography, sociology, anthropology, and history, as well as exact sciences like statistics and mathematics.\n",
      "Hover over the diagram with your mouse to see the exact numbers or percentages per year."
